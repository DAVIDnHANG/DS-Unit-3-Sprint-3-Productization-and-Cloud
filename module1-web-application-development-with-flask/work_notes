- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I follow along well. Everything was straight forward. 
    a. do not add extension on window terminal or in python file.
        for example. set FLASK_APP= hello.py does not work but FLASK_APP=hello works.
        in hello app, <hello.html> does not work, but <hello> works just the file name. on window.
        

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
I feel like the more method you know about these programs, the easier it is to do 
run your website.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Finding out how to use these method is difficults.
